# Activity 1: Investigating APIs

## what is API?

**`Application Programming Interface` (API) is a software program intermediary that allows programs to communicate with one another.**

***

## Types of API?

* `Open API:` Developers and other users can access open APIs, also known as external or public APIs, with few limitations. They may or may not require registration or the usage of an API key, and they may or may not be entirely open.

* `Web API:` APIs that may be accessed over the HTTP protocol are known as web APIs. The API specifies endpoints as well as acceptable request and response forms.

* `Partner API:` Partner APIs are comparable to open APIs in terms of functionality, but they have limited access that is generally managed by a third-party API.

* `INTERNAL API:` Internal APIs are meant to be concealed from outside consumers in comparison to open APIs. They are used to distribute assets inside a company. They allow various organizations or parts of a company to devour each other's equipment, data, and packages.

* `Composite API:` Integrated APIs allow developers to make a single call to numerous endpoints. This might be several services or data sources, or it could be different edges of a single API. Integrated APIs are particularly beneficial in microservice architecture, because a user may require data from many services in order to complete a single operation. Because a single request may obtain all of the data a user need, using integrated APIs can minimize server load and enhance application speed.

## Types of API Protocols

* REST:
  * REST is a web services API (short for Representational State Transfer).

* SOAP:
  * SOAP (simple object access protocol) is a well-known protocol that, like REST, is a form of Web API.

  * SOAP was the first to define how programs should handle services via network connections.
  
* RPC:
  * The earliest and most basic type of API interaction is the Remote Procedure Call. It's about running a piece of code on another server, and it may be turned into a Web API if done in HTTP or AMQP.

## Benefits of API?

* Increasing the positive customer experience.
* Enhances efficiency.
* Boosts productivity.
* Cost-cutting.
* Data is gathered for intelligence analysis.
* Enhances teamwork and connection.

***

## Difference between API and SDK?

* An `API` is essentially simply an interface for a service, but an `SDK` is a collection of tools, components, and code fragments designed for a specific purpose.

* An `API` is a collection of libraries that make up the core language and can be used right away, whereas an `SDK` is a development kit that makes it easier to use an API.
